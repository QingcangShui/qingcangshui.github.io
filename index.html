								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>
									My name is Qingcang Shui (in Chinese: 税擎苍). I am currently a Ph.D student at 
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ihep.ac.cn/">the Institute of High Energy physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IHEP, CAS)</a>,
									working on High Energy Astrophysics with my advisor 
									<a target="_blank" href=https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangshu>
										Prof. Shu Zhang
									</a> and collaborators.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the most remarkable predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) is the existence of black holes, objects in which gravity overwhelmingly dominates over other fundamental forces, resulting in a 										spacetime singularity encircled by an event horizon. 
									This event horizon signifies the point beyond which infalling matter or light cannot return. 
									Despite being the darkest entities in the universe, black holes are associated with some of the most luminous phenomena. 
									This luminosity arises from the accretion of matter, a fundamental astrophysical process that powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and X-ray binaries (XRBs), significantly shaping the 											universe we observe today. 
								</p>
								<p>
									My research interest is on using X-ray techniques (e.g., spectroscopy, timing and polarization) to study the accretion environment near compact objects, including black hole/neutron star 																binaries (BH/NS-XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

								<h2>Low-frequency Qausi-periodic Oscillations in BH-XRBs</h2>
								<p>
									Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs; roughly 0.1-30 Hz, <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ARA%26A..27..517V/abstract">van der Klis 1989</a>) 
									are the most prominent features observed in the power density spectra (PDS) of BH-XRBs, with the classifications of type A, B, and C based on the centroid frequency, quality factor, and rms amplitude (<a 												target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ARA%26A..44...49R/abstract">Remillard & McClintock 2006</a>). 
								</p>
								<p>
									In the past few decades, several models have been proposed to explain the dynamical origin of QPOs based either on the geometric or the intrinsic properties of the accretion flow. 
									Some examples of intrinsic models are the trapped corrugation modes (<a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ARA%26A..27..517V/abstract">Kato 1990</a>), 
									the accretion-ejection instability model (<a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...349.1003T/abstract">Tagger & Pellat 1999</a>) and the two-component 
									advection flow model (<a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...457..805M/abstract">Molteni et al. 1996</a>), etc. 
									For the geometric models, most of them are related to the relativistic Lense-Thirring (LT) precession, which was origin ally invoked to be 
									the dynamic mechanism of QPOs by <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...492L..59S/abstract">Stella & Vietri (1998)</a>. 
									As an extension of the relativistic precession model, the LT precession model proposed by <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.397L.101I/abstract">Ingram et al. (2009)</a> 
									assumes the entire hot flow precesses within the inner radius of the truncated disk (<a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...489..865E/abstract">Esin et al. 1997</a>).

									A useful test of different QPO theoretical models is phase-resolved analysis, which can help us understand the spectral and polarimetric variations with the QPO phase. Different models predict different phase varability 									patterns. However, different from pulsations detected in X-ray pulsars (XRPs),  the QPO phase has nonlinear and nondeterministic evolution over time. Therefore,  simply folding the light curve on a period is not 											appropriate when dealing with QPO signals. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) analysis is a powerful tool  for studying signals with nonstationary periodicity. This signal processing method was proposed by <a 												target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998RSPSA.454..903H/abstract">Huang et al. (1998)</a>.  HHT consists of two main components: mode decomposition and Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA). 
									The mode decomposition aims to decompose a time series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), while the HSA allows obtaining both the frequency and phase functions of the desired IMFs, such as the QPO 										component. 	During my PhD, I improved the tranditional HHT method by introducing Varational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Varational Mode Extractional (VME) algorithm in the signal processing routine and 										systematically employed our phase-resolved method to analyse QPOs in Galactic BH-XRBs (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...957...84S/abstract">Shui et al. 2023</a>), 											extragalactic ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...984..130S/abstract">Shui et al. 2025</a>) and AGNs.

								<h2>X-ray Pulsars</h2>
								<p> X-ray pulsars (XRPs) are strongly magnetized rotating neutron stars (NSs) in binary systems, accreting matter from their massive (spectral type late O or early B) companion star. Because of the strong magnetic field ( B > 									10^12 G), magnetic pressure dominates the ram pressure of the accreting gas. In this case, the fully ionized accreting plasma is funnelled by the magnetic field lines on to the magnetic poles of the NS, in which the 										kinetic energy of the in-falling matter is converted to heat and radiation.  It is generally accepted that the accretion mode of an accreting pulsars changes between sub and supercritical regimes with the mass accretion 									rate, hence with luminosity. The transition between the two accretion regimes occurs at the critical luminosity, L_crit , which is determined by the properties of the neutron star (e.g. magnetic field strength). In the 										supercritical regime, where L_x > L_crit , the radiation pressure dominates the gas deceleration, leading to the formation of an accretion column whose height could be positively correlated with the mass accretion rate. 									In the sub-critical regime, where L_x < L_crit,  the accreting gas is decelerated in the atmosphere of a neutron star or at some height either via Coulomb interactions, or through a collissionless shock above the stellar surface. 									The transition of X-ray pulsars between sub and supercritical states is expected to be associated with the changes of a beam pattern forming close to the neutron star surface. Beam pattern variations change the typical angle 									between the field direction and the momentum of photons leaving the radiation-forming region. 
 								</p>
								<p>
									In the subcritical regime, if the final deceleration of the infalling gas is governed by Coulomb interactions, one expects the existence of a Coulomb-stopping limit luminosity (L_coul). If L_x < L_coul,  the gas is decelerated 											through a gas-mediated shock near the neutron star surface, forming a small accretion mound. In this regime, the emission region rapidly approaches the stellar surface as L_x decreases, and the resulting radiation beam 									pattern consists solely of a pencil component. The physical picture described above represents one possible explanation; however, the detailed processes involved remain a subject of active debate.

								<h2>cyclotron resonant scattering features</h2>
								<p>
									A strong magnetic field in the vicinity of the neutron star surface could quantize the energy of electrons according to the Landau levels.  Resonant scattering of photons in these electrons then leads to the generation of 									resonance features (generally appearing in absorption) in X-ray spectra of XRPs. These absorption-like features are called cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs), and also called cyclotron lines. The centroid 										energy of the fundamental cyclotron line, E_cyc , is directly related to the magnetic field strength of the line-forming regions as E_cyc ≈ 11.6 × B12 keV, where B12 is the magnetic field strength in units of 10^12 G, hence 
									permits a direct measurement of the magnetic field strength near the neutron star surface. Importantly, the luminosity dependence of CRSF can trace the accretion regime of XRPs (see e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.528.7320S/abstract">Shui et al. 2024</a>).
